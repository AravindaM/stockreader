Stockboard helps investors to select the next public company to invest in. <br>
Work in progress, this system is not an MVP yet.

## Description

The Stockboard system is composed by four microservices that perform independent and well defined business tasks:

1. Stocks Reader * add link to repository<br>
It's responsible for keeping the Stockboard database up to date. This system reads the stock data from the internet and saves it into the system's DB.

2. Portfolio Manager * add link to repository<br>
It's responsible for managing the portfolios of the investors. This system creates, updates and deletes portfolios.

3. Market Analyzer * add link to repository<br>
It's responsible for executing analysis on the stock market. This system answers questions about the stock market. e.g: "Which stocks have lost more than 15% in the last 5 days?".

4. Stockboard-UI * add link to repository<br>
The Stockboard-UI is responsible for the graphic user interaface. It is a web application that provides a simple way to use the Stockboard platform.
